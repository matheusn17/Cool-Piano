# Cool Piano

A virtual piano made with LÃ–VE (love2d).

This repository is not meant to be used. It's just a personal example for training Lua/Love2d. However, feel free to clone it for whatever reason if you wish.


## Run

To run the project, clone it and run Love2d on the root dir.

You can also download the standalone binaries for Linux and Windows on the /binaries/ dir.
